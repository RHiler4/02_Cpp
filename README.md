Intro to C++, learning to do things you can already do in Java

Reading
=======

**C++ Programming** at WikiBooks.

All of the readings are free online, though note that the book is under constant revision. If something looks crazy, ask me about it.

1. Why our code is split into .h files and .cpp files: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/File_Organization (6p)
2. What is the :: operator for? https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Scope Stop at "unnamed namespace"
3. What does the compiler do? What does it NOT do? What does the pre-processor do? What does the linker do? https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Compiler Stop at "Compile speed" (4p) https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Compiler/Preprocessor (13p) https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Compiler/Linker (4p)
4. Bitwise operators. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#Bitwise_operators (2p)
5. Arrays, and the subscript operator. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#Subscript_operator_.5B_.5D (5p)
6. Pointers. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#address-of_operator_.26 and https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#Pointers.2C_Operator_.2A (9p) Skip the part about multi-dimensional arrays, and the part about pointers to functions.
7. Dynamic memory allocation. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#Dynamic_memory_allocation (4p)

Homework
========

1. Fork this repo
2. Use `git checkout` to check out your branch of the project (which is your unique id)
3. Fill in the blanks in the main.cpp with code that produces the correct result. Read the comments to find out what they ought to do.
4. Be sure to `git commit` and `git push` often
5. Update this file with your documentation and the answers to questions.
6. When you are ready to turn in your homework, submit a pull request from your branch in your repo, to your branch in MY repo.
7. Be sure to check the pull requests for my repo on github to make sure it worked, and that your work has been submitted.

Documentation
=========

For each of the following functions in main.cpp, tell me whether or not you think it is working in your submission.

1. prime - TODO
2. defix - TODO
3. sumSlice - TODO
4. square - TODO
5. listPrimes - TODO

Questions
=======

#### 1. In C++, the compiler compiles each .cpp file separately, without looking at the others. Explain why this leads to the need for .h files.

	-This leads to the need for .h files because we need to separate interface and implementation.  Header files declare what a certain class does, and it is then implemented in the .cpp file.

#### 2. Explain the individual roles of the preprocessor, the compiler, and the linker. What type of inputs do they take? What kind of outputs do they produce? What is the purpose of each?

	-The preprocessor takes high level language commands as texts and applys directives to them so that they can be read by the compiler, which then converts the code into an object file, once the files are converted the linker then uses the object files and library objects to create an executable file.

#### 3. What is a "pointer"?

	-A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, hence it points to it.

#### 4. If I have a variable declared as `int x`, how do I find out what memory address that variable is stored at?

	-Use the address of operator &, in this case &x.

#### 5. If I want a variable `p` that can store the address of an int, what type should I declare `p` to be?

	-int * p;

#### 6. Just like Java, C++ has a `new` command. But C++ also has a `delete` command that Java does not have. Why do we need `delete` in C++, but not in Java? What is `delete` good for?

	-In java there is no delete command because it automatically deallocates memory when an object is no longer referenced.  In C++ this must be done manually so we need to be able to call the delete function to deallocate unused memory space which is good for improving the runtime of functions.

#### 7. What is one question about C++ that you would like me to explain in class?

	-I would like an in depth explanation of the address of operator or basically a good example of how its used and/or why its useful.
